#1: Adding two numbers 
a1 = int(input("Enter no. 1 : "))
b1 = int(input("Enter no. 2 : "))
print("Sum = ", a1+b1)

#2: Printing remainder
print("Remainder = ", a1%b1)

#3: Checking datatype
a = 5
b = 7.7
c = "Aditya"
d = 'x'
e = True
f = None
print(type(a), type(b), type(c), type(d), type(e), type(f))
f = c
print(type(f))

#4: Using Comparison operator
print("a is greater than b : ", a1>b1)
print("a is lesser than b : ", a1<b1)

#5: Finding average of two numbers 
avg = (a1 + b1)/2
print("Average is ", avg)

#6: Calculate Square of number entered by user
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Square of the above number is : ", number*number) #can also write number**2


# ####class
# if(5>2):
#     print("true")

# if(5>2 and 7>5):
#     print("and")

# if(2>3 or 3>2):
#     print("or")
